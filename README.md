## 🎯 How It Works

- The sidebar is initially hidden (`left: -350px`).
- Clicking the hamburger icon toggles a hidden checkbox.
- When checked, the sidebar slides in from the left.
- Clicking the close (X) icon slides the sidebar back out.
- Social media icons at the bottom provide links for further engagement.

## ⚙️ Customization

- Change the background image by replacing `photo.jpg`.
- Update colors, fonts, or icons to match your brand/style.
- Add or remove menu items in the HTML as needed.
